The facility was located on a C-Type asteroid, and its entrance was a tunnel bored directly into the asteroid's surface.</p><p>Tragically, the original researchers at Ukweli-4 died in an accident whose exact nature remains unknown. As a result, the facility became abandoned and left to the ravages of time. Foundation personnel later recovered the meteorite and relocated it to another facility for continued research.</p><p>The fate of the Ukweli-4 facility remains shrouded in mystery, with no official records of the accident or the events that transpired.</p></div><div class="location-meta"><dl><dt>Cluster</dt><dd><a href="/database/locations/5/">Banquo</a></dd><dt>System</dt><dd><a href="/database/locations/6/">Ypsilon</a></dd></dl></div></content></main><footer class="footer"></footer></body></html>
