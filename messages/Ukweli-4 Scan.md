# Astrogation report

Surface is entirely covered with IMPACT CRATERS except for a 50m x 50m flat square at [[A]]. 

Analysis of flat area reveals TERRESTRIAL DISTURBANCES around the zone.

# Operations analysis

The field agent who identified Ukweli-4 reports a TUNNEL 3m high and 1m wide, bored directly into the asteroidâ€™s surface -- likely BLACK SITE ENTRANCE.

Absence of airlock or exterior structure suggests a containment class of Euclid or higher.

Deployment of Class D personnel highly recommended. 

Level 2 Hazard adjustment approved.
