## Appearance

Angus is a shorter man with a heavyset build and thick, almost luscious lips. He has piercing blue eyes that seem to constantly scan his surroundings, as if searching for vulnerabilities. He carries a revolver and wears an oversized, synthweave coat adorned with patches and stickers of various hacking tools and networks. A headset covers most of his skull and eyes, and he is constantly tapping at the keys or scrolling through screens on his wrist-mounted terminal.

## Personality

Angus is a ruthless and cunning businessman who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. He is fiercely loyal to [[REDACTED]], and he will do whatever it takes to protect their interests. Despite his tough exterior, Angus is also known to be charming and charismatic when it suits him, and he is skilled at manipulating people to get what he wants. He is respected by the hackers in his "flock," and he acts as their talent agent and protector.

## Background

Angus grew up on Prospero's Dream, where he learned how to survive in a tough and unforgiving environment. He became a prodigy hacker at a young age, and he used his skills to work his way up through the ranks of [[REDACTED]]. Eventually, he became one of [[REDACTED]] and used his intelligence and business acumen to build [[CANYONHEAVY|CANYONHEAVY.market]] into the sector's most powerful data brokerage firm. He now serves as its sysadmin, overseeing all of its systems and operations. He is respected and feared by his rivals for his significant contacts and willingness to take revenge if any of his hackers are harmed.
