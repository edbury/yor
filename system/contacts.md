# Contacts

1. Player describes NPC they are looking for. 
2. Warden determines appropriate Stat + Skill based on NPC. (Most likely Intellect + Rimwise.) 
3. Player rolls. 

Crit Success: NPC is a Friend. Create them with max starting loyalty. 
Success: NPC is created as normal. 
Failure: See Circles Twists (emnity, etc) 
Critical Failure: NPC is an Enemy. Create them with minimum starting loyalty.

Player: "I want to find someone who can decrypt this harddrive." 

Warden: "Okay, roll a Contacts check." 

Contacts check by default: Intellect + Relevant Skill (Rimwise, Psychology, Etc) If the result is... 

Crit Success: Player names this NPC. NPC is a Friend. Create them with max starting loyalty. 
Success: Player names this NPC. NPC is created as normal. 
Failure: Warden names this NPC. Apply a Contacts Twist. 
Critical Failure: Warden names this NPC. NPC is an Enemy. Create them with minimum starting loyalty. Apply a Contacts Twist.

Two modifiers I'm thinking of: 
1. High Score could add a flat bonus to your Contacts roll as an indicator of how well known you are. (High Score 6 = +6%) This would also give the Warden a bonus when an enemy is trying to find you. 
2. Faction membership would give you a bonus based on the strength of the faction. These would scale the same as Skills, so +10%, +15%, +20%. 

A roll using every modifier might look like: Intellect + Rimwise (10%) + High Score (4%) + Tempest Company Membership (Level 3 Faction, +20%)

so once y'all roll up a Contact, they would go on your individual sheets. "This is _my_ NPC" (unless someone else builds a relationship with them)

Rimwise: +15% 
Referral from another NPC: +10% 
Relevant Faction: +20%
NPC has Master Skill: -15%
