- A Squad Leader has Toomb's challenge coin.

## Read-Alouds

As players approach the station:

> As you approach Anarene's Folly, you can see the small spindle shape of the station rotating gently against the background of stars. It's a dingy, utilitarian space station, with a few lights shining dully in the windows. A large sign on the front of the station reads, "Anarene's Folly: Fuel, Supplies, Repairs." You can see the silhouettes of people moving behind the illuminated windows on the station's interior. You hear a crackling transmission over your ship's communication system, "Welcome to Anarene's Folly, incoming vessel. This is Space Traffic Controller Simon Wainwright. Please state your business before requesting docking permissions."

> "Please hold while we scan your vessel and arrange a docking bay."

As the teamster shuttle arrives:

> As you look out the viewport, you see a familiar sight. The sleek form of the teamster shuttle you took to Cerberus Station approaches Anarene's Folly, its engines shining brightly in the light of the star system. The ship's communications systems flashing as it tries to hail you.

If they discover the Creation Device:

> You pry open the hydroponics equipment crate, revealing the false bottom beneath. The packing material has been expertly cut and reassembled to create the hiding place, but it looks like it has been untouched for some time. You carefully lift away the layer of foam, revealing a sleek metal warhead. It's compact, no larger than a basketball, with a matte black finish and a series of blinking lights on its surface. The device is surrounded by an array of wires and pipes, leading to a small tank filled with a strange, greenish fluid. There's a small label stuck on the side, reading "A79: Creation Device."

If the device is destroyed:

> As you watch, the Creation Device shatters into a million pieces, releasing a volatile storm of chemicals, biological agents, and mutagens. Within moments, the area is consumed by an ever-expanding mass of writhing flesh and sinew, a grotesque conglomeration of body parts and organs that seems to have a mind of its own. The ship itself begins to bubble and writhe, as though alive, and massive appendages sprout from the growing mass, reaching out to claim all nearby matter. The destructive force of the Creation Device is devastating, leaving behind nothing but a nightmare landscape of organic ruin.

## Station Escalation Timeline

- [x] Ship hailed by STC, told the docks are in use and backed up and to maintain a holding pattern
  - Station’s initial scans detect the colonization device’s signature. STC stalls while station brass formulates a plan to recover the device for personal gain.

> "Attention, incoming vessel. This is Anarene's Folly Space Traffic Control. I'm afraid our docks are currently backed up. Please maintain a holding pattern while we clear the way. Over."

- [x] Ship asked to transfer controls over to station AI to remotely coordinate docking.

> "Greetings, Captain. This is Simon Wainwright of Anarene's Folly. I apologize for the inconvenience. To help us coordinate your landing safely, I'm going to need you to transfer control of your ship to our station AI. This will allow us to remotely guide you in and get you safely docked in no time. Is that something you're able to do for us, Captain?"

  - Controller calmly denies requests for manual docking, citing strict technological and safety requirements.

> "I'm sorry, but I'm afraid manual docking is strictly prohibited by station regulations. Our advanced AI system is equipped to handle all docking procedures to ensure the safety of all ships and personnel on board. I hope you understand."

  - Once control is transferred station AI begins systematically hacking into the ship’s other systems. Begin the Systems Hack Timeline starting with Piloting. Progress the countdown by 1 each subsequent step in the Station Escalation Timeline.
  - Ship’s holding pattern altered to give the appearance of occasional approach, no other motions towards docking.
- [x] Ship momentarily targeted with station weapons systems, warning briefly sounds.

> As you wait in your ship, the view through the viewport suddenly flashes red. A loud, automated warning blares through the ship's speakers: "INTRUDER ALERT. THIS IS ANARENE'S FOLLY SPACE TRAFFIC CONTROL. CEASE ALL ENGINE ACTIVITY AND PREPARE TO BE BOARDED." The weapons systems of the station have locked onto your ship, and the you can see the intimidating gleam of laser sights on the hull. Suddenly, the warning ceases and the station's weapon systems disengage.

  - Station gunner acquires player ship as target before being ordered to disengage. Station fears detonating the device.
  - STC plays off warning as laser positional targeting to expedite docking process.

> "Sorry about that, Captain. No need for alarm, this is just our laser positional targeting to make sure we get you into dock smoothly and quickly," Simon's voice crackles over the ship's communication system. "It's a standard procedure here at Anarene's Folly, nothing to worry about. The guidance beams are aligned, and you'll be safely secured in no time."

- [x] Station deploys military dropship to player ship.
  - STC informs the crew the station is dispatching a shuttle with repair technicians to investigate technical difficulties with docking
  - Dropship is loaded with Marines ordered to retrieve the colonization device. [See Marine Info]. Utilize Improvised Tech Jargon table if crew presses Marines about their work.

> The dropship's exterior is covered in dents and scrapes, indicative of heavy use. A large floodlight mounted on the top illuminates the surrounding area, casting a bright glow in all directions. The shuttle's rigging gun is visible on one side, along with a mounted machine gun turret. The craft appears to be a standard repair shuttle, ready and available for any necessary maintenance or repair work.

- [x] Dropship occupants begin “repairing” player ship.
  - Marines dressed as Teamsters unload and begin preparing for breach.
  - Visual inspection reveals they carry conventional weapons.
  - Marines guard player ship’s exterior airlock[s], hit anyone attempting escape with [dropship] floodlights, commanding them to return inside and opening fire on the noncompliant.
  - Marines prepare for extraction, sabotaging systems where possible.
  - Without direct airlock access, breaching charges set on cargo bay exterior or last known package location.
  - Exterior cameras, optical instruments and antennae destroyed.

> You see a figure clad in a bulky vaccsuit slowly making their way down the corridor. They carry a small tool kit in one hand, and a pulse rifle is slung over their shoulder. They are wearing a heads up display which projects a variety of information and data onto their helmet visor. The suit's life support systems emit a soft, rhythmic hum, and the sound of the figure's footsteps is muffled by the mag-boots they wear. 
> 
> (With Military Training) Despite their rough, utilitarian appearance, they move with a grace and precision that suggests military training. They nod to you in greeting as they approach, and you can't shake the feeling that this person is not what they seem.

- [x] Anarene’s Folly evacuates all nonessential crew.
  - All remaining docked vessels depart simultaneously and hastily.
  - STC offers vague and ominous explanations.

> A chaotic scene begins to unfold. The once peaceful and orderly docking bays are now filled with a frenzied flurry of activity. The mining vessel that was once securely docked at one of the terminals is now firing up its engines, readying for liftoff. The cargo ship, which was previously unloading its goods, is now hastily stowing its cargo and starting its engines. The passenger ship, which was previously docked, is also in a rush to depart. The autocannons on the station are now manned, rotating to cover all angles as the ships make their hasty departures.

- [x] Marines execute battle plan.
  - If AI still controls computer systems: Marines enter via airlocks. Otherwise they request entry from players for repairs. Failing both, Marines blast and cut their way in.
  - AI coordinates Marine efforts: isolates crew behind locked doors, disables artificial gravity, etc.

## Gaslighting Table

1. Artificial Time Dilation. Clocks tick slower. Communications take longer to connect. Doors slower to open.

> As you move about the ship, you begin to feel as though time itself has slowed to a crawl. The seconds stretch out interminably, and even simple tasks seem to take an eternity to complete. Despite your best efforts, communications systems seem unresponsive, doors take an age to open, and every computing action is carried out with maddening slowness.

2. Warning lights/messages turn off and on, sending crew on wild goose chases of repair.
3. Cryopod engaged and frosted over. Locked but empty [Life Support system control required].
4. Burning food and coffee, leaking sewage.  
5. Lights flicker and strobe, shine blindingly or burn out.  
6. Doors open and close erratically. “Accidentally” shut on crew, causing harm.  
7. High frequency whine and static pumped over PA. Blasting, discordant music.  

> As you move through the ship, you begin to notice a high-pitched whine that grows in volume. Suddenly, it feels as though the very air around you is vibrating with an electric energy. The ship's PA system crackles to life, and an ear-splitting burst of static blares out. The sound is so intense that it's almost painful, and it fills the entire ship, echoing from every surface and making it difficult to think clearly.

8. Artificial gravity subtly increased, making tasks more difficult. Suddenly engaged and disengaged.  
9. Ship’s logs spliced to construct fake audio. Crew’s voices played over comms used to lure and confuse. Distressingly warped messages from family [Comms system control required].  
10. Fold-out beds violently actuated. Quarters and barracks appear tossed.
