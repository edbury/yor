# The Story So Far

## The Vaylen

XX years ago, vaylen expansion is halted by the Dead Planet. Vaylen jump technology is significantly vulnerable to The Gate.

Kruger (with naiven worms) is one of a handful of vaylen who make it out of the system when the gate is unpowered. (Check Dead Planet for a relevant time in history)

Kruger arrives in 32819L on the Carpathia and discovers that humans here (other than the Foundation) have no knowledge of the vaylen. 

The Foundation discovers the Carpathia and its distortion drive + grav/pressor. While the ship is full of human bodies, this is technology unknown to this part of the galaxy.

Kruger creates Undine using a naiven worm and dedicates himself to recovering the Carpathia and getting home.

Undine infiltrates Site 17, eventually taking over Director Carrey.

Undine wipes all records of the vaylen from Site 17's archives, is discovered in the process, and steals the Carpathia. 

In an effort to avoid the Dead Planet, Undine forces a distortion shutdown (?) mid-jump. The crew, not in cryo and untrained for distortion jumps, start to unravel. Undine convinces one of them to help her hull a new host.

Eventually, the Carpathia returns to 32819L, Undine escapes via pod, and their work continues.

Kruger has not been sitting on his hands, tho much time is spent in cryo. He arranges for them to hull a Foundation contractor, and arranges for the transfer of The Screwdriver to Site 24. (Maybe there's a third vaylen now? One who helps Undine hull Gupta, etc) Undine hulls Gupta, causes the breach, and flees with the BLOOM vaccine.

Undine arrives on The Dream, sheds Gupta for a new host.

During this time, Kruger has discovered the existence of Cloudbank (Site... 6?) and gets involved in the research on Cerberus Station as a means of reaching home. His knowledge of distortion drives speeds up their work significantly, as does his funding. (Maybe this is how they escape the Dead Planet to begin with? "I knew it would work because I've done it before.")

Before the crew arrives, he travels back to the Empire (?) / the Dead Planet? If DP, maybe he doesn't come back. Maybe Undine is the one who gets in touch, knowing they're looking for her "father".
