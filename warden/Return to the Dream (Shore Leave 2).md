# Return to the Dream

## Notes

- Aosta is decoding Kruger's data for the team
- Dr. X - Angus Contact, Success
- Toombs - Stein Contact, Failure

## Jump Complete

Aosta is waiting for the PCs at jump point in the _Carpathia_.

### Aboard the Carpathia

- The cargo deck has been transformed into a containment unit and science facility
- The ship has Medpods aboard to restore wounds; costs come out of their paychecks

### Aosta's Meeting Agenda

- Debrief re: Cerberus Station
  - Can decode Kruger's jump data if the PCs offer it
  - The Suit isn't anomalous, so they aren't required to turn it over
  - What they do with Pi is up to them; he undergoes a screening aboard the Carpathia and comes up clean
- Debrief re: Anarene's Folly
  - The Carpathia intercepted Wainwright's dropship because he was broadcasting an unencrypted message about Derringer's crew
    - Wainwright has been disavowed by his corporation (name?), who claim he was acting on his own
    - Unclear how the corporation knew about [[Artifact 79]]
    - The corporation has also cut their contract with Tempest Co. because they couldn't successfully retrieve the artifact--public reason being that they allowed Wainwright to "commandeer an entire station"
  - The Warhead _is_ anomalous, and also a planet-killer, so he expects them to turn it over in exchange for a Hazard 5 bonus. He notes that the Dream will surely pick it up on sensors if a station as dinky as Anarene's Folly could
- Next steps:
  - O5 wants the Gupta issue put to bed ASAP--he's a rogue agent with way too much information about The Foundation
  - Contact him before they leave the Dream. He gives them a gentle reminder that they are free to pursue any leads they see fit, but they are employees first and foremost.

## The Dream

### Dry Dock

- Reidmar and his Teamsters are waiting in Loshe's office. It's a long wait while Loshe pulls the logs from both ships, but Reidmar is satisfied and pays the crew 25kcr for the return of the shuttle.
- Afterward, Reidmar sends Billy a hail. He asks him to bring the crew to Sem's Bar in two days. He has a job for them. 

### Events!

Whatever the crew is doing before they meet Reidmar:

- Undina makes contact with Elyod via anonymous hail.
  - She knows what happened to Gupta.
  - She knows what Reidmar wants from them.
  - She wants to meet first, at the Golden Triangle, Room 236.

After the crew meets with Reidmar:

- Angus makes contact with Doctor X.
  - He knows about Reidmar's job, and he wants in. He is looking to install a clandestine monitoring device in XeroCorp’s prison management AI Echo. He will pay 25kcr to anyone capable of getting the job done and not getting caught.
  - He also asks Doctor X if "his teamsters" can be trusted. If so, he'll be in touch after the job.

If the crew tells Aosta about the job:

- He wants them to upload a virus to corrupt the XeroCorp AI--scraping all experimental data on compound X187 from Prison Station Echo’s internal servers. Return with the info on the high-frequency datastick they’re provided, along with a sample of X187.
  - The Foundation doesn't have much info on X187. Kulakov miners found the compound one month ago, deep in their southern hemisphere mine. The miners who came into contact with X187 suffered sudden bouts of violence and paranoia, along with rapid psychological changes. A standard request for evaq was sent and XeroCorp answered.

If the crew tells Aosta about Undina:

- He's skeptical that any such human empire could exist without the Foundation having a record of it. He suggests they accept her terms and report back as soon as they have any further info. If she's connected to Kruger and Gupta, she's an accessory to at least one of the breaches, if not all.

### Meeting Undina

Undina is Kruger's "daughter." She's been jumping bodies since the Carpathia heist fifty years ago--tho from her perspective, it hasn't been nearly as long. To the crew, she presents as a human traveler from a distant arm of the galaxy. Kruger is her father, and they both just want to go home.

- Her people have a vast interstellar empire, far unlike anything in rimspace. She looks down on and can't fathom how capitalism has such a stranglehold on humans. To her, rimspace is dirty, uncouth, and sad.
- She wants two things: a copy of Kruger's jump space data and the recovery of her brother, Sylvestris.
- Sylvestris was arrested by XeroCorp several months ago. He's being held in Prison Station Echo--the same prison that Reidmar is going to ask them to infiltrate. She tells them that Sylvestris was arrested trying to make contact with "some miners' collective" for Imogene Kane. She doesn't have any other details for them.
- She and Kruger know about ACMD. They aren't aware of the specifics, but Imogene has been working with them in order to help cure it. This is the reason she gives for her people's lack of cyberware.
- She will treat her knowledge about Gupta as a bargaining chip, but doesn't require a hard sell. She wants the PCs to trust her and see her as amenable. Gupta is dead in the bathroom, shot through the head point blank. Undina has placed the room in stasis using an omega crystal device. In her version of events, Gupta was working with Imogene Kane to help develop a vaccine for the illness and someone killed him for it. Undina tells the crew she has been hiding out, afraid for her life, and preserved the crime scene for her father. In truth, she and Sylvestris killed Gupta's body once it became clear the crew had tracked them to the Dream.
- The Deal: Undina knows the PCs don't have a ship of their own. It's not a wild guess, since almost no one does. She also knows that Reidmar won't give them the job unless they can supply their own ship--he can't have any teamster vessels associated with the break-in. What's more, it'll be difficult to contract _any_ ship with a drive larger than Jump-1. If they can bring back her brother alive, she'll give them the rat ship (Jump-3 Drive) (possible source: Kruger recovered from the Scrap Rats sector). The ship's astrogation computer currently has a hard lock from the Dream to the Carnath jump point, but she'll unlock it and hand over the IFF records upon completion of the job.

#### The Crime Scene

- Undina doesn't have much to cover up. Sylvestris shot Gupta's body through the head for her, so any investigation will turn up that he was, indeed, shot through the head point blank. The exit wound destroyed any evidence of his being hulled.
- Give the crew any info they want to know! It's all a ruse for now.

#### The Ship

- The Ship is in Dry Dock. Generate it using the Scrap Rats tables with each player rolling for one aspect.

### The Job

- Reidmar meets the crew at Sem's. He discusses his business openly, at the bar, assuming Angus is reporting his activities to Yandee. First, he needs to know if the crew can procure access to a Jump-2 ship. If so, he needs to know how comfortable they are working outside corporate interests. 
- He wants them to travel to Carnath, break into Prison Station Echo, and extract a member of the Stratemeyer Syndicate. 
- If the crew can successfully return the Stratemeyer agent, he'll pay them 50kcr. 
- He's arranged for the crew to pose as the night time cleaning services team. Normally, XeroCorp would never take on contract labor, but a labor dispute on Carnath has their service staff spread thin. He warns them that XeroCorp is going to search them and every inch of any vessel they arrive on--it is a prison after all. However, he has a man on the inside. He can sneak in one item each to the prison cook who will be waiting for them. They can identify themselves with the phrase "the deep dark mine".
