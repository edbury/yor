**Location:** [DATA REDACTED]

Site 17 is the second largest Foundation facility, primarily focused on the containment and study of low-risk humanoid entities, although the Site has additional capacities for the containment of inanimate objects, non-humanoid creatures, and higher risk anomalies. 

In addition, Site 17 is the sector's operational hub, overseeing [DATA REDACTED] subordinate outposts.

As per its main focus, Site 17's permanent staff includes a large number of medical and psychiatric professionals, to deal with the unique physical and psychological needs of both the contained anomalies and the on-site staff working in this challenging environment.
