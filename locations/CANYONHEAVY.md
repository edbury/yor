# CANYONHEAVY.market

Location
: Sector 6

CANYONHEAVY.market is an exclusive and feared information brokerage and hacking collective. Access is typically restricted to vetted clients, first met in a private booth at [[The Stellar Burn]].

## Background

CANYONHEAVY is run by the cunning and ruthless sysadmin [[Angus]]. The Market is effectively [[REDACTED]], but it is renowned in its own right. Angus acts as uncle and shepherd to CANYONHEAVY's mongrel band of hackers and serves as their talent agent. The purchasing of equipment and talent is all done through him. He always pays for good information, rumors, and any data that can't be obtained through purely digital means. 

If any of his flock is abused or killed, his significant contacts ensure swift revenge.
