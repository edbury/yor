# The Babushka

Name
: The Babushka (real name unknown)

Occupation
: Proprietor of [[The Chop Shop]]

Mods
: Unknown. Assume everything.

## Appearance

The Babushka appears to be in her late 50s and has a stocky build. She has wiry grey hair and is always carrying either a sawed-off shotgun or a MegaTranq rifle. She is known for her dirty lab coat and boots, which are often covered in grime and blood.

## Background

The Babushka is a legendary cybersurgeon who is fiercely private and has a good heart. She is clinically removed from her patients, rarely speaking and instead letting her holographic AI child, Zhenya, handle most of the bedside manner. She keeps a hoarder's home, barely kept up by her and Zhenya, and appointments at [[The Chop Shop]] are made through Zhenya after a background check proves that the patient is on good terms with [[REDACTED]].
