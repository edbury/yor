# Kruger

Name
: Kruger

Location
: Unknown

Occupation
: Unknown

## Appearance

Kruger is a tall, muscular man with long white hair and a refined, well-groomed appearance. He has piercing blue eyes that are often hidden behind a pair of reflective, wraparound sunglasses. Kruger's face is clean-shaven and he has a strong, chiseled jawline. He is usually dressed in a smart, tailored business suit, with a crisp white shirt and a sleek black tie. Despite his professional appearance, assume that Kruger is armed and dangerous.

## Background

Very little is currently known about Kruger. He boarded the Teamster ship "Freighter XJ7C" shortly after meeting with Imogene Kane, and it is believed that he may be involved in her insurgency. It is unclear what Kruger's motivations are, or what role he will play in the ongoing conflict on Prospero's Dream.
