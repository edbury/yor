# The Dry Dock

Location
: Prospero's Dream, Sector 1

There are hundreds of bays in “The Dry Dock." Each of them is filled with the harsh screech of grinding metal and dozens of shipbuilders who scurry, unattached on scaffolding dangling above massive ships. 

## Boarding the Dream

Ships of Hull 70 or lower can enter through the dry dock. Once inside, the ship will be attached and locked into the station via crane and stored in the stacks until the ship is ready for departure, or else transported to the dry dock for repairs. 

Ships of Hull 71 or greater must be moored to the station’s piers. After the ship is moored a shuttle will be sent to retrieve anyone coming aboard.

Every ship is required to have an up-to-date manifest which includes the captain, crew, and cargo. 

If you only want to refuel you don’t have to pay the docking fee, though you can’t disembark your ship.
