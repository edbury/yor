# The Stellar Burn

Location
: Sector 2

The Stellar Burn is a popular entertainment venue on Prospero's Dream, offering a range of attractions including live music, dancing, games, and private booths. The club is divided into three levels: the main floor, where the bar and stage are located; the upstairs level, known as Heaven, where private booths can be rented for more exclusive entertainment; and the lower level, known as The Ecstasy, where companionship can be bought. 

The Stellar Burn is known for its high-energy atmosphere and eclectic clientele. It is managed by [[Jury "Sem" Semenov]], a short, stocky man with a number of tattoos and a cybernetic implant in his palm. The club is dark, smoky, and filled with strobing lights and flashing lasers. It is the place to unwind and do much of the station's "business." Security is handled by Gundrones and Tempest Company Probies.
