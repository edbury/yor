# Site 24

Status
: Decommissioned due to containment breach

Location
: Murandal

Site 24 is a group of facilities on the planet Murandal that includes DeLange, Japline's Ache, and Choi Labs. DeLange is an orbital station responsible for managing the arrivals and departures of supplies, specimens, reports, and workers, while Japline's Ache is a surface habitation serving as a midpoint between DeLange and the underwater labs. Choi Labs is situated on the ocean floor and contains storage, labs, security facilities, and habitation for the majority of workers.

Unfortunately, Site 24 suffered a disastrous containment breach of [[Artifact 38]], an infectious mold that aggressively consumed and rebuilt the organic mass of those it infected. The labs were sabotaged with the shipment of an anomalous screwdriver, [[Artifact 21]], leading to a breach in the underwater facilities. The infection quickly spread, causing loss of life among the lab staff and eventually leading the remaining security staff to seal the underwater facilities. 

A field team of D-Class successfully retrieved samples and data from the labs.
