# Cerberus Station

Cerberus Station was a deep space research facility that was conducting experiments on wormholes and faster-than-light travel. The experiments were referred to as Project Charon and resulted in the creation of a self-sustaining wormhole. However, this success was short-lived as the station became overrun by the dead who refused to stay dead, driven by an unknown intelligence. The station was ultimately destroyed when its orbit was destabilized and it veered into the sun.
