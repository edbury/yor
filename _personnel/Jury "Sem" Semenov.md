## Appearance

Jury is a short, stocky man with a thick neck and broad shoulders. He has close-cropped blond hair and piercing green eyes. He has a number of tattoos on his arms and chest, including a large, ornate eagle on his left bicep. He is usually found behind the bar at The Stellar Burn, dressed in a black button-up shirt and a sleek black apron.

## Background

Jury is the manager of the club level at [[The Stellar Burn]], a popular entertainment venue in Sector 2. He is known for his rough, blue-collar politics, but looks down on communists and insurgents. Anyone wishing to access the private booths on the upstairs level of the club will need to have their retinas scanned by a cybermod in Sem's palm.
