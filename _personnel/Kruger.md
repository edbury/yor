## Appearance

Kruger is a tall, muscular man with long white hair and a refined, well-groomed appearance. He has piercing blue eyes that are often hidden behind a pair of reflective, wraparound sunglasses. Kruger's face is clean-shaven and he has a strong, chiseled jawline. He is usually dressed in a smart, tailored business suit, with a crisp white shirt and a sleek black tie. Despite his professional appearance, assume that Kruger is armed and dangerous.

## Background

Very little is currently known about Kruger. He boarded the Teamster ship "Courier XJ7C" shortly after meeting with Imogene Kane, and it is believed that he may be involved in her insurgency. 

Most recently, Kruger traveled through the artificial wormhole at [[Cerberus Station]]. His current status and whereabouts are unknown.

It is unclear what Kruger's motivations are or what role he plays in the ongoing conflict on [[The Dream]].
