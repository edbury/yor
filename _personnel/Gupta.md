## Appearance

Andre Gupta is a thin man in his late 30s, with dark skin and a closely cropped black haircut that reveals a small patch of shaved skin on the back of his head. He has a narrow face with a sharp nose and deep-set brown eyes. Despite his slender build, Andre has a quick, agile way of moving that suggests he is more capable than he might initially appear. When he was last seen, Andre was transporting two cargo crates.

## Background

Andre Gupta has a Ph.D. in xenobiology and formerly worked as a C-Class Technician for The Foundation. However, he recently absconded from Choi Labs, an installation at [[Site 24]], with proprietary data and two samples of the BLOOM vaccine. It is unclear what Gupta's motivations were for taking this action, or what he plans to do with the stolen data and samples.
