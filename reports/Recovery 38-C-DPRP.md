# Recovery 38-C-DPRP: "Bloom"

After recovery of [[The Carpathia]], Site 17 forces aboard [[The Barishal]] were directed to Site 24 for refuel and repair. En route to the facility, [[Director Aosta]] received news of a facility-wide containment breach at Site 24. The O-5 council has offered Aosta jurisdiction over Site 24 if he can recover the artifact that caused the breach as well as a back up of the facility's servers.

The initial recovery attempt by Site 17 agents has failed. Director Aosta awakened the D-Class party from cryo and offered them a deal: recover the sample and data backups in exchange for full completion of their volunteer service and an additional Hazard 5 stipend. Because this is a keter-class breach, the facility will be nuked from orbit if safe exfiltration is not possible.

Before disembarking, the party gathered whatever materials were available on The Barishal and disembarked onto Orbital Relay Station "DeLange". The party found all personnel had been killed by a Foundation agent, who then attempted to isolate himself via EVA. The agent's body had been entirely consumed by some sort of fungus that produced a rust-colored gas.

The party proceeded to Surface Habitation "Japline's Ache" via the automated station shuttle. On the surface, the party found signs of contamination and several dead bodies. An ice rover in working condition was located in the garage, and a supply warehouse was unlocked. Also drugs. From here, the party descended into Choi Labs proper via an industrial lift, cutting through the planet's crust of ice into the ocean below.

At Surface Access, the security gate codes had been overridden to allow full access in both directions. D-191 gained access to the system and locked down the security gates for anyone without the proper transponders, coded to the party. 

The party then took the cargo lift deeper into the labs, arriving at the Crossroads airlock. Here, they encountered two bodies that had been consumed by a red fungus, covered in what appeared to be white flower blossoms. Once inside the lab, the party was contacted by Eunha Taibhse, a Foundation technician stationed at Site 24.

Eunha informed the party that a breach occurred shortly after the arrival of Artifact 21, a screwdriver. After the breach of Sample 38, "Bloom," the labs were flooded by a hull breach in External Environs Testing. Eunha has agreed to assist the party in their recovery efforts--with the promise that the party extract her from Choi Labs as well. She is locked in the comms room on the flooded level. Additionally, Eunha has warned the party that some sort of creature is nesting in the maintenance shaft below the Crossroads junction.
