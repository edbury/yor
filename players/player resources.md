### At a glance

1. **What if a roll is equal to my Stat Check or Save?** It's a failure. 
2. **Levels and XP are gone.** _Traveler_ inspired "you get what you get" approach. Character advancement now revolves around resting during "shore leave" and spending Stress to improve Saves. Stats mostly stay the same, Saves improve as you survive. 
3. **Armor Saves are gone.** Replaced with Armor Points (AP), provided by equipment you wear. If you suffer damage that's lower than your AP, you suffer no damage. Suffer damage in excess of your AP, the AP absorbs damage equal to its value, and is then destroyed. Cover has its own AP values. 
4. **The Panic Dice have Changed:** 2d10 Panic die replaced with a single 1d20. Quicker to use and easier to understand. 
5. **PC Health adopts the Hits system:** Like NPC's, PC's now have pools of health called "Wounds". Most classes have two wounds, each holding 10+1d10 health. When a pool of health has been depleted, roll on the Wounds table and suffer a critical effect. Damage values have been scaled down to be brought in line. 
6. **Character sheet Loadouts are gone:** Replaced with separate random loadouts table for each class, rolled during character generation. Much more restrictive and flavorful. 
7. **Skills no longer provide ancillary benefits:** Skills don't have mechanical sub-rules attached to them. (Example: Tactics no longer provides Speed check advantages), due to very often being edge case rules that were almost always forgotten. It's encouraged for GM's to add these back in where desired. 
8. **Strict Distances have been replaced with Range Bands:** Makes for quicker and more intuitive play. 
9. **Locations now have Comfort Saves:** Affects rolling to relieve stress (and boost saves). More comfortable / safer locations allow for easier Comfort Saves. 
10. **Panic Table Updated:** Now includes Conditions, persistent effects that require treatment. Panic table tweaked to be less gross when dealing with real issues of mental health.
