# Wounds and death

## What are wounds?

Whenever you gain a Wound, roll 1d20 on the **Wounds Table** according to the type of Damage.

- **Blunt Force:** Getting punched, hit with a crowbar or thrown object, falling, etc.
- **Bleeding:** Getting stabbed or cut.
- **Gunshot:** Getting shot by a firearm.
- **Fire & Explosives:** Grenades, flame throwers, doused in fuel and lit on fire, etc.
- **Gore & Massive:** Damage from giant creatures or particularly gruesome foes.

You can use common sense and the **Severity** column as a guide: **Flesh Wounds** are small inconveniences. **Minor/Major Injuries** cause lasting damage that require treatment. **Lethal Injuries** can kill you if not dealt with immediately. And **Fatal Injuries** can potentially kill you outright. Additionally, some Wounds cause **bleeding**, which if not stopped can quickly overwhelm you.

## Death

Whenever you would die, the Warden makes a **Death Check** by placing a d10 in a cup, shaking the cup, and placing it face down on the table (covering the die). As soon as someone spends a turn checking your vitals, the die is revealed and the roll is looked up on the **Death table** below. 

If your character's death is imminent, make your last moments count: save someone's life, solve an important mystery, give the others time to escape. Enjoy the carnage, then jump back in for more!

| 5-6 | **You are comatose.** Only extraordinary measures will return you to the waking world.                |

| 9   | **You are unconscious.** You will wake up in 2d10 minutes. Permanently reduce your max Health by 1d5. |
