# Medical care

No matter how careful you are, sooner or later you are going to get hurt. Minor injuries can usually be treated with a quick rest, but Wounds and Conditions require professional treatment.

## Short term recovery

Once per day, whenever you rest, your body will attempt to heal itself naturally. After 6+ hours of rest, make a Body Save. If successful, you reset your health to its maximum.

Note: your Wounds, however, remain the same.

## Long term recovery

Recovering Wounds, conditions, or damage to your stats and saves takes a longer time. See the **Medical Expenses** table for a non-comprehensive list of available treatments.
