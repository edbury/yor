# Pay

## How much does a job pay?

Most jobs pay on a sliding scale based on the crew member's salaries.

### Salary

Players who work for the Company earn a monthly salary based on what skills they have acquired. They typically get:

- 500cr/month for every **Trained Skill**
- 1,000cr/month for every **Expert Skill**
- 2,000cr/month for every **Master Skill**

### Jump pay

Because time spent in hyperspace isn't consistent, the Company pays a flat Jump Pay bonus equal to the Jump x 1,000cr regardless of distance traveled or time spent in hyperspace.

### Hazard pay

During incredibly dangerous work, the Company may settle on paying 1d5 months of salary as a Hazard Pay bonus. This payment does not constitute an admission of liability on the part of the Company or its agents.
