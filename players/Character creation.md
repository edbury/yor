# Character creation

## What's going on?

Your character has volunteered as a D-Class Research Subject in order to evade punishment for a capital crime. Upon successful completion of your 720 hours of service, The Foundation will provide an unblemished ID as well as a significant stipend based on your service record.

Who or what is The Foundation? What does it mean to be D-Class? Is any of this legal?

These aren't the sort of questions that get people off of death row. 

## Making a character

Follow the character creation guidelines in the PSG with these exceptions:

- Skip **Step 8**. D-Class volunteers are not allowed to carry personal items, equipment, or credits. You will roll for these items upon completion of your service.
- During **Step 9**, make two changes:
  - D-Class volunteers are not identified by name in order to preserve volunteer privacy and avoid humanization. Roll 3d10 and arrange the results into the format "D-###". This is your designation.
  - Under "Personal Information", write the crime that landed you in this situation.
- That's it! Now head down to Processing, so we can get you fitted for a Black Box.
