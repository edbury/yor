# Combat and defense

## How do I attack?

Make a Combat Check. If successful, roll your weapon's damage and subtract it from your enemy's health. If you fail, the situation gets worse and you gain 1 Stress. Critical Successes deal double damage and Critical Failures trigger a **Panic Check**.

## Damage

When you take **damage (DMG)** subtract it from your health. If your health reaches zero, you gain a **Wound** and roll on the **Wounds table**. Then reset your health to its maximum and subtract any carryover damage. Some weapons deal Wounds directly and do not affect your health total. If you suffer more wounds than your maximum, make a **Death Check**.

## Armor

You ignore all damage less than your armor's **Armor Points (AP)**. However, if you ever take damage greater than or equal to your AP in one hit, you armor is destroyed and you suffer any remaining damage. Weapons that deal damage in Wounds automatically destroy your armor and deal the Wound directly to you. Some armor (like [[Advanced Battle Dress]] may protect you from one or more Wounds before being destroyed.

## Cover

Your environment provides protection called **Cover**. It can be destroyed, just like armor, whenever you deal damage greater than or equal to is AP. Cover typically only prevents against ranged attacks, but sometimes will protect against hand-to-hand attacks. **If you shoot while in Cover, you are considered out of Cover until your next turn.**
