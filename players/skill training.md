# Skill training

## Train a skill

To learn a new skill, you'll need to spend the requisite amount of time and credits.

- **Trained Skills:** 2 years + 10kcr in materials
- **Expert Skills:** 4 years + 50kcr in materials
- **Master Skills:** 6 years + 200kcr in materials

To train an Expert Skill requires on Trained prerequisite and to train a Master Skill requires on Expert prerequisite.

### Why does it take so long?

Skill training assumes that you are working full time, going on missions, and generally living life. If you are studying full-time (by going to school, for example) then training takes half as long. Your Warden may allow additional resources (private tutoring, AI assistance, cybermods, slickware, etc.) to decrease the time required to acquire a skill.

### Military Training

Military Training is a special exception to the regular rules of Skill Training. It's free, for one. Second, you have to sign a 6-year contract with your local Colonial Marine regiment. To find out what happened during your service, make a Combat check:

- **Success:** you gain Military Training, Athletics, and 2 Trained Skills. You add +10 Combat and reduce another stat by 10. You gain the Marine's **Trauma Response**.
- **Critical Success:** as Success, but you may take an Expert Skill instead of the 2 Trained Skills.
- **Failure:** You gain Military Training, Athletics, 1 Trained Skill, and the Marine's **Trauma Response**.
- **Critical Failure:** You were killed in action.
